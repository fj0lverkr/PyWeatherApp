# A small weather script in Python

To make this work you should add a file 'api.py' which contains your api keys:

openweathermap key:
OWMKEY = "YOUR_API_KEY"

This script uses Nerdfont glyphs to display weather icons. Please install a compatible Nerdfont from https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads
